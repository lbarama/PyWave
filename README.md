# pywave
pywave is the project name for the python algorithm currently under development.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your computer. I recommend using the GitHub desktop client. Once cloned to your computer you can use package without fully installing it. Use the script below to load the package

```
import sys
path_to_pywave = 'C:/Users/<USERNAME>/Documents/GitHub/7139_USAF_Seismic_ML'
sys.path.append(path_to_pywave)
from pywave import *
```

Note that the path you enter in must be correct for your computer. Fortunately this will remain the same since it is the location of the GitHub folder.
